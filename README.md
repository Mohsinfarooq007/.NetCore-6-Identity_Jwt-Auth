# .NetCore-6-Identity_Jwt-Auth
Complete Signup + Roles Creation + SignIn + Jwt Token Generation and Authentication + Authorization

Note: There is an attribute located at the top of the UserController..(In my case, it was necessary to specify to the compiler that it was JWT authentication; otherwise, it would throw an error.)
